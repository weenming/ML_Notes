## Background
*Relavent researches*
Existing research: small graphs -> this work: defend adverserial attacks on GNN at scale [[GNN]] [[At Scale]] [[Adverserial Attack]]

[[Surrogate Loss]]es are not suitable for global attacks [[To Learn]]

New robust [[Aggregation Function]]: [[Soft Meadian]] 


## Method


## Contributions
*The problem that this work solves*

- Attack: Novel attack technique of attacks on GNNs which saves memory [[Adverserial Attack]]
