## Why 
*Why did I choose to read this article?*
[[Soft Medoid]], relavent work of [[Robustness of Graph Neural Networks at Scale]] to defend [[Adverserial Attack]] on [[GNN]]s

## Background
*Relavent researches*


## Method

[[Soft Medoid]], using soft argmin of geometric median, which can be also seen as a weighted mean, weighted with 
$$
x_i = \sum_{i}{x_i\exp{-{1\over T}\sum_j \|x_i - x_j\|_2} \over \sum_k \exp{-{1\over T}\sum_j \|x_k - x_j\|_2}}
$$
