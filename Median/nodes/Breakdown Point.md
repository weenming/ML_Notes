> Described in terms ofÂ [breakdown points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistics#Breakdown_point), the median has a breakdown point of 50%, meaning that half the points must be outliers before the median can be moved outside the range of the non-outliers, while the mean has a breakdown point of 0, as a single large observation can throw it off.
